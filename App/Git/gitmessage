# -- Type --
# Must be one of the following:
#
# build:    Changes that affect the build system, CI configuration or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
# chore:    Other changes that don't modify src or test files
# docs:     Documentation only changes
# feat:     A new feature
# fix:      A bug fix
# perf:     A code change that improves performance
# refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# style:    Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
# test:     Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# wip:      Work in progress
#
# -- Scope --
# The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change.
# For example: Service, Entity, Admin, etc...
#
#
# -- Subject --
# The subject contains a succinct description of the change.
# Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# Don't capitalize first letter
# Do not add a dot (.) the end
#
# -- Body --
# Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
# The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
#
#
# -- Footer --
# The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit Closes.
# Breaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
# Closes:          The issue this commit closes
# BREAKING CHANGE: If anything is broken
#
